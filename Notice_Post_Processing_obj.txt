***Post Processing on obj files generated by the space colonization algorithm***

The space colonization algorithm generates an obj file. But it needs post-processing.

1- Use Meshmixer to delete big triangles generated. save the result as an obj file.
2- Use 3D Builder on Windows to open the file. Move the tree. Then use Modify->merge to merge all the different parts of the file. Save as obj file.
3- Use Meshmixer to make solid the file. Open Meshmixer, import the obj file then Edit->Make solid->Accept. You can see that now the geometry is smooth.
4- Repair the obj file. With Meshmixer Analysis->Inspector->Auto repair all->Done.
5- Apply the scale factor. With Meshmixer Edit->Transform->size Z put the size that you want->Accept. Check that ‘Uniform scaling’ is selected. In our case 40mm.
6- If you need to Remesh use Ctrl+A ->Remesh.
7- Export as obj or stl or what you want.
