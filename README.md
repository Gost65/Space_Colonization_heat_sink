# PRESENTATION
Topic: Heat transfer generative design.  
Goals: Create a heat sink with a generative design.  
Why: to give the best shape to the heat sink.  
How? : Using Space colonization algorithm I create a tree shape. I export the shape in 3D  
       I do a heat simulation with SolidWorks to analyze the shape designed with the algorithm.  


# THIS REPOSITORY
This repository contains the space colonization algorithm.  
I based my work on an existing code.  
The source is provided in the Credit section.  
I made modifications to the code to export it.  


# SOFTWARE
Processing : https://processing.org/  
SolidWorks: https://www.solidworks.com/  


# PROBLEM
I want to export the tree generated as an STL but I can't.  
I cheated using boxes but I have problem with the STL file to modify it.  

# LIBRARY
obj export: nervoussytem library (https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/tools/obj/).  
Camera: peasycam library (https://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).
